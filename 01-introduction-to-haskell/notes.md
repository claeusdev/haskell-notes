# Introduction to Haskell - Notes

## Overview

Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language named after logician Haskell Curry. It represents one of the most mathematically elegant and theoretically sound programming languages available.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pure Functions
- Functions have no side effects
- Same input always produces same output
- No mutation of external state
- Mathematical function definition

### 2. Immutability
- Data structures cannot be modified after creation
- New versions created instead of mutations
- Eliminates many classes of bugs
- Enables safe concurrent programming

### 3. Lazy Evaluation
- Expressions evaluated only when needed
- Enables infinite data structures
- Can improve performance through avoiding unnecessary computations
- Requires understanding of evaluation order

### 4. Strong Static Type System
- Compile-time type checking
- Type inference reduces verbosity
- Prevents runtime type errors
- Enables powerful abstractions

### 5. First-Class Functions
- Functions can be passed as arguments
- Functions can be returned as values
- Enables higher-order programming
- Functional composition

## Core Philosophy

### Mathematical Foundation
Haskell is based on lambda calculus and category theory, providing:
- Rigorous mathematical semantics
- Compositional reasoning
- Algebraic properties
- Formal verification capabilities

### Expressiveness vs Safety
- High-level abstractions
- Safety without sacrificing performance
- Compile-time guarantees
- Elegant problem solutions

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
2. Install Cabal or Stack for package management
3. Set up development environment
4. Install language server for IDE support

### Basic Tools
- **GHCi**: Interactive interpreter
- **GHC**: Compiler
- **Cabal**: Package manager and build tool
- **Stack**: Alternative build tool
- **Haddock**: Documentation generator

## Common Misconceptions

### "Haskell is Only Academic"
- Many production systems use Haskell
- Active commercial ecosystem
- Strong industry adoption in finance and tech

### "Haskell is Slow"
- GHC produces efficient code
- Lazy evaluation can improve performance
- Parallel and concurrent programming support

### "Haskell is Hard to Learn"
- Different paradigm requires mindset shift
- Excellent learning resources available
- Strong community support

## Development Environment Setup

### Recommended Setup
1. **GHCup**: Version manager for GHC
2. **VSCode** with Haskell extension
3. **HLS**: Haskell Language Server
4. **Stack**: Build tool and package manager

### Useful Packages
- `base`: Core library
- `containers`: Data structures
- `text`: Efficient text processing
- `bytestring`: Byte string operations
- `mtl`: Monad transformer library

## Best Practices

### Code Style
- Use meaningful names
- Prefer explicit type signatures
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use pattern matching effectively

### Project Organization
- Organize modules hierarchically
- Separate pure and impure code
- Use appropriate abstraction levels
- Document public APIs

### Learning Strategy
- Start with simple examples
- Practice regularly
- Read existing code
- Engage with community
- Build projects incrementally
