## Function Fundamentals: The Building Blocks

### Function Definition Syntax: Expressing Intent

Haskell's function definition syntax is both simple and powerful, allowing you to express complex computations clearly and concisely.

**Basic Function Definition:**
```haskell
-- Basic function definition
functionName :: Type1 -> Type2 -> ... -> ReturnType
functionName parameter1 parameter2 = expression

-- Example: Simple arithmetic
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- Example: String processing
greet :: String -> String
greet name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

-- Example: List processing
doubleAll :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleAll [] = []
doubleAll (x:xs) = (x * 2) : doubleAll xs
```

**Function Types and Signatures:**
- **Type signatures** serve as contracts and documentation
- **Arrow notation** (`->`) represents function types
- **Right associativity** means `a -> b -> c` is `a -> (b -> c)`
- **All functions** take exactly one argument and return one value

```haskell
-- Understanding function types
-- These are equivalent:
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)

-- Function type constructor
(->) :: * -> * -> *  -- Takes two types, returns a function type

-- Common function types
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
```

### Function Application: How Functions Are Called

Function application in Haskell is simple but powerful, with important implications for how code is structured and executed.

**Basic Function Application:**
```haskell
-- Function application is left-associative
f x y z = ((f x) y) z

-- Examples
add 3 4          -- 7
multiply 2 5     -- 10
greet "Alice"    -- "Hello, Alice!"

-- Function application with parentheses
result1 = add (multiply 2 3) 4  -- add 6 4 = 10
result2 = add (multiply 2 3) (multiply 1 2)  -- add 6 2 = 8
```

**Application Operator ($):**
The `$` operator provides a convenient way to avoid parentheses and can make code more readable.

```haskell
-- Application operator
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
f $ x = f x

-- Using $ to avoid parentheses
-- Instead of: sqrt (3 + 4 * 5)
result1 = sqrt $ 3 + 4 * 5

-- Instead of: map (*2) (filter even [1..10])
result2 = map (*2) $ filter even [1..10]

-- Chaining with $
result3 = map (*2) $ filter even $ take 10 [1..]

-- $ has lowest precedence, so everything to its right is evaluated first
```

**Function Composition vs Application:**
```haskell
-- Function composition (.)
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(f . g) x = f (g x)

-- Using composition
processData :: [Int] -> [Int]
processData = map (*2) . filter even . take 10

-- Equivalent with application operator
processData' :: [Int] -> [Int]
processData' xs = map (*2) $ filter even $ take 10 xs

-- Composition is often more readable for data pipelines
```

### Function Types: Understanding the Type System

Haskell's type system provides rich information about functions, enabling powerful abstractions and type safety.

**Basic Function Types:**
```haskell
-- Simple function types
identity :: a -> a
identity x = x

-- Functions with constraints
add :: Num a => a -> a -> a
add x y = x + y

-- Higher-order functions
applyTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
applyTwice f x = f (f x)

-- Functions that return functions
makeAdder :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
makeAdder n = \x -> x + n
```

**Polymorphic Function Types:**
```haskell
-- Type variables represent polymorphism
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

-- Multiple type variables
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith _ [] _ = []
zipWith _ _ [] = []
zipWith f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith f xs ys

-- Constrained polymorphism
sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
sort [] = []
sort (x:xs) = sort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++ sort (filter (>= x) xs)
```

## Currying and Partial Application: The Power of Functions

### Understanding Currying: Functions as Values

Currying is a fundamental concept in Haskell where all functions are automatically curried—they take one argument and return a function that takes the next argument.

**What is Currying:**
```haskell
-- These are equivalent
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)

-- Currying in action
add 5 :: Int -> Int  -- Returns a function that adds 5
add 5 3 :: Int       -- Returns 8

-- Manual currying
add' :: Int -> Int -> Int
add' = \x -> \y -> x + y

-- Uncurrying (converting to take a tuple)
addUncurried :: (Int, Int) -> Int
addUncurried (x, y) = x + y
```

**Benefits of Currying:**
1. **Partial Application**: Create specialized functions
2. **Function Composition**: Easier to combine functions
3. **Code Reuse**: Build complex functions from simple ones
4. **Point-Free Style**: Write functions without explicit arguments

```haskell
-- Partial application examples
addFive :: Int -> Int
addFive = add 5

multiplyBy :: Int -> Int -> Int
multiplyBy = (*)

double = multiplyBy 2
triple = multiplyBy 3

-- Operator sections for partial application
greaterThanFive = (>5)
addToTen = (10+)
subtractFromTen = (10-)

-- Using partial application
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = map double numbers        -- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
filtered = filter greaterThanFive numbers  -- [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### Partial Application: Creating Specialized Functions

Partial application allows you to create new functions by providing some arguments to existing functions.

**Basic Partial Application:**
```haskell
-- Creating specialized functions
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven = (== 0) . (`mod` 2)

isOdd :: Int -> Bool
isOdd = (== 1) . (`mod` 2)

-- String processing functions
addPrefix :: String -> String -> String
addPrefix prefix str = prefix ++ str

addErrorPrefix = addPrefix "ERROR: "
addWarningPrefix = addPrefix "WARNING: "

-- List processing functions
takeFirst :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
takeFirst = take

takeFive = takeFirst 5
takeTen = takeFirst 10
```

**Advanced Partial Application Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Function factories
makeValidator :: (a -> Bool) -> String -> (a -> Either String a)
makeValidator predicate errorMsg = \x ->
    if predicate x
        then Right x
        else Left errorMsg

-- Creating validators
positiveValidator = makeValidator (>0) "Must be positive"
nonEmptyValidator = makeValidator (not . null) "Must not be empty"
lengthValidator = makeValidator ((>= 5) . length) "Must be at least 5 characters"

-- Using validators
validateInput :: String -> Either String String
validateInput input = nonEmptyValidator input >>= lengthValidator
```

**Partial Application with Higher-Order Functions:**
```haskell
-- Creating specialized higher-order functions
mapToInt :: (String -> Int) -> [String] -> [Int]
mapToInt = map

mapLengths = mapToInt length
mapReads = mapToInt read

-- Filtering with partial application
filterBy :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filterBy = filter

filterEvens = filterBy even
filterOdds = filterBy odd
filterPositives = filterBy (>0)
```

## Function Composition: Building Complex Functions

### The Composition Operator (.)

Function composition is a powerful technique for building complex functions from simple ones, creating elegant data transformation pipelines.

**Basic Composition:**
```haskell
-- Function composition operator
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(f . g) x = f (g x)

-- Simple composition examples
doubleAndSquare :: Int -> Int
doubleAndSquare = (^2) . (*2)

-- Multiple composition
processText :: String -> String
processText = reverse . map toUpper . words . filter isAlpha

-- Composition with different types
getLength :: String -> Int
getLength = length . words

-- Composition in data pipelines
analyzeData :: [String] -> [Int]
analyzeData = map length . filter (not . null) . map (filter isAlpha)
```

**Advanced Composition Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Composition with higher-order functions
mapAndFilter :: (a -> b) -> (b -> Bool) -> [a] -> [b]
mapAndFilter f p = filter p . map f

-- Composition with multiple arguments
composeWithTwo :: (c -> d) -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> d
composeWithTwo f g = f . g

-- Example usage
addAndSquare = composeWithTwo (^2) (+)
result = addAndSquare 3 4  -- (3 + 4)^2 = 49
```

**Composition vs Application:**
```haskell
-- Using composition (often more readable)
processData1 :: [Int] -> [Int]
processData1 = map (*2) . filter even . take 10

-- Using application operator
processData2 :: [Int] -> [Int]
processData2 xs = map (*2) $ filter even $ take 10 xs

-- Mixing both for clarity
processData3 :: [Int] -> [Int]
processData3 = map (*2) . filter even . take 10

-- When to use each:
-- Use (.) for data transformation pipelines
-- Use ($) to avoid parentheses in complex expressions
```

### Point-Free Style: Functions Without Arguments

Point-free style (also called tacit programming) allows you to write functions without explicitly mentioning their arguments.

**Basic Point-Free Style:**
```haskell
-- Point-free style
sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfSquares = sum . map (^2)

-- Equivalent point-full style
sumOfSquares' :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfSquares' xs = sum (map (^2) xs)

-- More point-free examples
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven = (==0) . (`mod` 2)

countWords :: String -> Int
countWords = length . words

-- Complex point-free function
processNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers = map (*2) . filter (>0) . map (+1)
```

**Advanced Point-Free Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Point-free with multiple arguments
addAndDouble :: Int -> Int -> Int
addAndDouble = (*2) . (+)

-- Point-free with higher-order functions
compose3 :: (c -> d) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> d
compose3 f g h = f . g . h

-- Point-free data processing
analyzeText :: String -> (Int, Int, [String])
analyzeText = 
    let wordCount = length . words
        charCount = length . filter (not . isSpace)
        longWords = filter ((>5) . length) . words
    in (wordCount, charCount, longWords)
```

**When to Use Point-Free Style:**
- **Use when**: It makes the code more readable and expresses intent clearly
- **Avoid when**: It makes the code obscure or harder to understand
- **Good for**: Data transformation pipelines and simple functions
- **Bad for**: Complex logic with multiple conditions

```haskell
-- Good point-free style
processList :: [Int] -> [Int]
processList = map (*2) . filter even

-- Bad point-free style (too obscure)
mysterious = (.) . (.) . (.)

-- Better alternative
compose3 f g h x = f (g (h x))
```

## Higher-Order Functions: Functions as First-Class Citizens

### Essential Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They are the foundation of functional programming.

#### Map: Transforming Lists

`map` applies a function to every element of a list, creating a new list with the transformed elements.

```haskell
-- Map definition
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

-- Basic map examples
doubleAll :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleAll = map (*2)

squareAll :: [Int] -> [Int]
squareAll = map (^2)

-- Map with different types
stringLengths :: [String] -> [Int]
stringLengths = map length

-- Map with complex functions
processNames :: [String] -> [String]
processNames = map (map toUpper . filter isAlpha)

-- Nested map (map of maps)
mapMap :: (a -> b) -> [[a]] -> [[b]]
mapMap = map . map
```

**Advanced Map Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Map with multiple arguments using partial application
addToAll :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int]
addToAll n = map (+n)

-- Map with conditional logic
mapIf :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapIf p f g = map (\x -> if p x then f x else g x)

-- Map with state (using State monad)
mapWithIndex :: (Int -> a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapWithIndex f = map (uncurry f) . zip [0..]
```

#### Filter: Selecting Elements

`filter` selects elements from a list that satisfy a predicate.

```haskell
-- Filter definition
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter _ [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x = x : filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs

-- Basic filter examples
evens :: [Int] -> [Int]
evens = filter even

positives :: [Int] -> [Int]
positives = filter (>0)

-- Filter with complex predicates
longWords :: [String] -> [String]
longWords = filter ((>5) . length)

-- Filter with multiple conditions
validEmails :: [String] -> [String]
validEmails = filter (\s -> '@' `elem` s && '.' `elem` s)
```

**Advanced Filter Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Filter with index
filterWithIndex :: (Int -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filterWithIndex p = map snd . filter (uncurry p) . zip [0..]

-- Filter and transform
filterMap :: (a -> Maybe b) -> [a] -> [b]
filterMap f = mapMaybe f

-- Filter with state
filterAccum :: (s -> a -> (Bool, s)) -> s -> [a] -> [a]
filterAccum f s [] = []
filterAccum f s (x:xs) = 
    let (keep, s') = f s x
    in if keep then x : filterAccum f s' xs else filterAccum f s' xs
```

#### Fold: Reducing Lists

`fold` (also called `reduce`) combines all elements of a list into a single value.

**Right Fold (foldr):**
```haskell
-- Right fold definition
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f z [] = z
foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)

-- Basic fold examples
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList = foldr (+) 0

productList :: [Int] -> Int
productList = foldr (*) 1

-- Fold with different types
concatList :: [String] -> String
concatList = foldr (++) ""

-- Fold to build lists
reverseList :: [a] -> [a]
reverseList = foldr (:) []
```

**Left Fold (foldl):**
```haskell
-- Left fold definition
foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl f z [] = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs

-- Left fold examples
sumLeft :: [Int] -> Int
sumLeft = foldl (+) 0

-- Strict left fold (prevents space leaks)
foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl' f z [] = z
foldl' f z (x:xs) = let z' = f z x in z' `seq` foldl' f z' xs

-- Use foldl' for performance
sumStrict :: [Int] -> Int
sumStrict = foldl' (+) 0
```

**Advanced Fold Patterns:**
```haskell
-- Fold with early termination
foldrWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldrWhile p f z [] = z
foldrWhile p f z (x:xs)
    | p x = f x (foldrWhile p f z xs)
    | otherwise = z

-- Fold with state
foldState :: (s -> a -> s) -> s -> [a] -> s
foldState f s [] = s
foldState f s (x:xs) = foldState f (f s x) xs

-- Fold to build complex data structures
buildTree :: [a] -> Tree a
buildTree = foldr insert Empty
  where
    insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
    insert x (Node y left right)
        | x <= y = Node y (insert x left) right
        | otherwise = Node y left (insert x right)
```

#### Other Essential Higher-Order Functions

**Zip and ZipWith:**
```haskell
-- Zip functions
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zip [] _ = []
zip _ [] = []
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys

zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith _ [] _ = []
zipWith _ _ [] = []
zipWith f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith f xs ys

-- Examples
addPairs :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
addPairs = zipWith (+)

multiplyPairs :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
multiplyPairs = zipWith (*)
```

**TakeWhile and DropWhile:**
```haskell
-- TakeWhile and DropWhile
takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile _ [] = []
takeWhile p (x:xs)
    | p x = x : takeWhile p xs
    | otherwise = []

dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile _ [] = []
dropWhile p xs@(x:xs')
    | p x = dropWhile p xs'
    | otherwise = xs

-- Examples
takePositives :: [Int] -> [Int]
takePositives = takeWhile (>0)

dropSpaces :: String -> String
dropSpaces = dropWhile isSpace
```

**All and Any:**
```haskell
-- All and Any
all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
all p = foldr (&&) True . map p

any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
any p = foldr (||) False . map p

-- Examples
allEven :: [Int] -> Bool
allEven = all even

anyOdd :: [Int] -> Bool
anyOdd = any odd
```

## Advanced Function Patterns and Idioms

### Function Factories: Creating Functions Dynamically

Function factories are functions that create other functions, enabling powerful abstractions and code reuse.

```haskell
-- Basic function factory
makeMultiplier :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
makeMultiplier n = (*n)

-- Usage
double = makeMultiplier 2
triple = makeMultiplier 3

-- Advanced function factory
makeValidator :: (a -> Bool) -> String -> (a -> Either String a)
makeValidator predicate errorMsg = \x ->
    if predicate x
        then Right x
        else Left errorMsg

-- Creating validators
positiveValidator = makeValidator (>0) "Must be positive"
nonEmptyValidator = makeValidator (not . null) "Must not be empty"
emailValidator = makeValidator (\s -> '@' `elem` s) "Must contain @"

-- Function factory for list processing
makeProcessor :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
makeProcessor predicate transform = map transform . filter predicate

-- Usage
processPositives = makeProcessor (>0) (*2)
processLongWords = makeProcessor ((>5) . length) (map toUpper)
```

### Memoization: Caching Function Results

Memoization is a technique for caching function results to avoid redundant computation.

```haskell
-- Simple memoization for fibonacci
memoFib :: Int -> Integer
memoFib = (map fib [0..] !!)
  where
    fib 0 = 0
    fib 1 = 1
    fib n = memoFib (n-1) + memoFib (n-2)

-- More general memoization
memoize :: (Int -> a) -> Int -> a
memoize f = (map f [0..] !!)

-- Using memoization
memoFactorial = memoize factorial
  where
    factorial 0 = 1
    factorial n = n * memoFactorial (n-1)

-- Memoization with Map for arbitrary types
import qualified Data.Map as Map

memoizeMap :: Ord a => (a -> b) -> a -> b
memoizeMap f = snd . go Map.empty
  where
    go memo x = 
        case Map.lookup x memo of
            Just result -> (memo, result)
            Nothing -> 
                let result = f x
                    newMemo = Map.insert x result memo
                in (newMemo, result)
```

### Combinators: Building Blocks for Functions

Combinators are functions that combine other functions in useful ways.

```haskell
-- Basic combinators
identity :: a -> a
identity x = x

const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x

flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
flip f x y = f y x

-- Function composition combinators
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(.) f g = \x -> f (g x)

(>>>) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
(>>>) = flip (.)

-- Advanced combinators
on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
on f g x y = f (g x) (g y)

-- Usage
compareOn :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> a -> a -> Ordering
compareOn = on compare

-- Sort by length
sortByLength = sortBy (compareOn length)

-- Combinator for error handling
try :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> a -> b
try f g x = f x `catch` \_ -> g x
```

## Performance Considerations

### Efficiency of Higher-Order Functions

Understanding the performance characteristics of higher-order functions is crucial for writing efficient Haskell code.

**Fusion Optimization:**
```haskell
-- GHC can optimize chains of higher-order functions
-- This gets optimized to a single loop
processNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers = map (*2) . filter (>0) . map (+1)

-- Less optimal: intermediate lists created
processNumbers' :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers' xs = 
    let step1 = map (+1) xs
        step2 = filter (>0) step1
        step3 = map (*2) step2
    in step3
```

**Space Considerations:**
```haskell
-- Space leak with foldl
badSum :: [Int] -> Int
badSum = foldl (+) 0  -- Builds up thunks

-- Good: Strict evaluation
goodSum :: [Int] -> Int
goodSum = foldl' (+) 0  -- Evaluates immediately

-- Memory-efficient list processing
efficientProcess :: [Int] -> [Int]
efficientProcess = 
    let go [] acc = reverse acc
        go (x:xs) acc = 
            let newAcc = if x > 0 then x * 2 : acc else acc
            in go xs newAcc
    in go []
```

**Lazy Evaluation Benefits:**
```haskell
-- Lazy evaluation can prevent unnecessary computation
expensiveComputation :: Int -> Int
expensiveComputation n = sum [1..n]

-- This won't compute until the result is actually used
lazyResult = expensiveComputation 1000000

-- Only compute what you need
firstTen = take 10 $ map expensiveComputation [1..1000]
```

## Real-World Applications

### Data Processing Pipelines

Higher-order functions excel at creating data processing pipelines.

```haskell
-- CSV processing pipeline
processCSV :: [String] -> [(String, Int)]
processCSV = 
    map parseRow . 
    filter (not . null) . 
    map (filter isAlpha . words)

parseRow :: [String] -> (String, Int)
parseRow [name, count] = (name, read count)
parseRow _ = ("Unknown", 0)

-- Log analysis pipeline
analyzeLogs :: [String] -> [(String, Int)]
analyzeLogs = 
    map (parseLogEntry . words) . 
    filter (isPrefixOf "ERROR") . 
    map (dropWhile isSpace)

parseLogEntry :: [String] -> (String, Int)
parseLogEntry ("ERROR":msg:count:[]) = (unwords msg, read count)
parseLogEntry _ = ("Unknown", 0)
```

### Configuration Processing

```haskell
-- Configuration validation pipeline
validateConfig :: Config -> Either String Config
validateConfig config = 
    validateEmail (email config) >>
    validateAge (age config) >>
    validateName (name config) >>
    return config

-- Using higher-order functions for validation
validateField :: (a -> Bool) -> String -> a -> Either String a
validateField predicate errorMsg value = 
    if predicate value
        then Right value
        else Left errorMsg

-- Creating validators
validateEmail = validateField (\s -> '@' `elem` s) "Invalid email"
validateAge = validateField (>0) "Age must be positive"
validateName = validateField (not . null) "Name cannot be empty"
```

### Financial Calculations

```haskell
-- Portfolio analysis using higher-order functions
data Holding = Holding { symbol :: String, shares :: Double, price :: Double }

-- Calculate portfolio value
portfolioValue :: [Holding] -> Double
portfolioValue = sum . map (\h -> shares h * price h)

-- Calculate portfolio risk
portfolioRisk :: [Holding] -> Double
portfolioRisk holdings = 
    let totalValue = portfolioValue holdings
        weights = map (\h -> (shares h * price h) / totalValue) holdings
        variance = sum $ map (^2) weights
    in sqrt variance

-- Filter and analyze holdings
analyzeHoldings :: [Holding] -> (Double, Double, [Holding])
analyzeHoldings holdings = 
    let totalValue = portfolioValue holdings
        risk = portfolioRisk holdings
        highValue = filter (\h -> shares h * price h > 1000) holdings
    in (totalValue, risk, highValue)
```

## Best Practices and Common Patterns

### Function Design Principles

1. **Small, focused functions**: Each function should do one thing well
2. **Pure functions**: Avoid side effects when possible
3. **Meaningful names**: Function names should describe their purpose
4. **Type signatures**: Always provide type signatures for top-level functions

### Composition Guidelines

1. **Read left to right**: Use (.) for data transformation pipelines
2. **Use ($) judiciously**: Avoid parentheses where it improves readability
3. **Point-free when clear**: Use point-free style when it enhances clarity
4. **Partial application**: Leverage currying for reusable functions

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```haskell
-- BAD: Overusing point-free style
mysterious = (.) . (.) . (.)

-- GOOD: Clear and readable
compose3 f g h x = f (g (h x))

-- BAD: Ignoring laziness implications
processLargeList = foldl (+) 0 . map expensiveFunction

-- GOOD: Use strict fold when appropriate
processLargeList' = foldl' (+) 0 . map expensiveFunction

-- BAD: Not leveraging partial application
isPositive x = x > 0
doubleList xs = map (\x -> x * 2) xs

-- GOOD: More idiomatic
isPositive = (>0)
doubleList = map (*2)
```

This comprehensive understanding of functions and higher-order patterns forms the foundation for advanced Haskell programming and leads naturally into more sophisticated abstractions like functors and monads.

## Currying and Partial Application

### Understanding Currying

All functions in Haskell are automatically curried - they take one argument and return a function that takes the next argument.

```haskell
-- These are equivalent
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)

-- Partial application
addFive :: Int -> Int
addFive = add 5

-- Using partial application
increment = (+1)
double = (*2)
halve = (/2)
```

### Benefits of Currying

1. **Partial Application**: Create specialized functions
2. **Function Composition**: Easier to combine functions
3. **Code Reuse**: Build complex functions from simple ones
4. **Point-Free Style**: Write functions without explicitly mentioning arguments

### Examples of Partial Application

```haskell
-- Creating specialized functions
multiplyBy :: Num a => a -> (a -> a)
multiplyBy n = (*n)

double = multiplyBy 2
triple = multiplyBy 3

-- Operator sections
greaterThanFive = (>5)
addToTen = (10+)
subtractFromTen = (10-)
```

## Function Composition

### The Composition Operator (.)

```haskell
-- Function composition
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(f . g) x = f (g x)

-- Examples
doubleAndSquare :: Int -> Int
doubleAndSquare = square . double
  where
    square x = x * x
    double x = x * 2

-- Multiple composition
processText :: String -> String
processText = reverse . map toUpper . words . filter isAlpha
```

### Benefits of Composition

1. **Readability**: Express data transformations clearly
2. **Modularity**: Build complex operations from simple parts
3. **Reusability**: Compose existing functions in new ways
4. **Reasoning**: Easier to understand and verify correctness

### Application Operator ($)

```haskell
-- Application operator (function application with lowest precedence)
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
f $ x = f x

-- Useful for avoiding parentheses
sqrt $ 3 + 4 * 5    -- Instead of sqrt (3 + 4 * 5)
```

## Higher-Order Functions

### Definition

Higher-order functions are functions that:
1. Take other functions as arguments, OR
2. Return functions as results, OR
3. Both

### Essential Higher-Order Functions

#### Map
```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

-- Examples
map (*2) [1,2,3,4]           -- [2,4,6,8]
map length ["hello", "world"] -- [5,5]
map (map (*2)) [[1,2],[3,4]] -- [[2,4],[6,8]]
```

#### Filter
```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

-- Examples
filter even [1,2,3,4,5,6]    -- [2,4,6]
filter (>5) [1,8,3,9,2,7]    -- [8,9,7]
filter null [[], [1], [], [2,3]] -- [[],[]]
```

#### Fold (Reduce)
```haskell
-- Right fold
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f z []     = z
foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)

-- Left fold
foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl f z []     = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs

-- Examples
foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]        -- 10
foldl (*) 1 [1,2,3,4]        -- 24
foldr (:) [] [1,2,3]         -- [1,2,3]
```

#### Strict Left Fold
```haskell
-- Strict left fold (prevents space leaks)
foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

-- Use foldl' for performance in most cases
sumList = foldl' (+) 0
productList = foldl' (*) 1
```

### Advanced Higher-Order Patterns

#### Zip and ZipWith
```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

-- Examples
zip [1,2,3] ['a','b','c']        -- [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]
zipWith (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]      -- [5,7,9]
zipWith (*) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]      -- [4,10,18]
```

#### TakeWhile and DropWhile
```haskell
takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

-- Examples
takeWhile (<5) [1,2,3,6,4,7]     -- [1,2,3]
dropWhile (<5) [1,2,3,6,4,7]     -- [6,4,7]
```

#### All and Any
```haskell
all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool

-- Examples
all even [2,4,6,8]              -- True
any odd [2,4,6,8]               -- False
```

## Function Patterns and Idioms

### Point-Free Style

Writing functions without explicitly mentioning their arguments:

```haskell
-- Point-free style
sumOfSquares :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfSquares = sum . map (^2)

-- Equivalent point-full style
sumOfSquares' :: [Int] -> Int
sumOfSquares' xs = sum (map (^2) xs)

-- More examples
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven = (==0) . (`mod` 2)

countWords :: String -> Int
countWords = length . words
```

### Function Pipelines

```haskell
-- Using function composition for data pipelines
processData :: [String] -> [Int]
processData = map length . filter (not . null) . map (filter isAlpha)

-- Alternative with application operator
processData' :: [String] -> [Int]
processData' xs = map length $ filter (not . null) $ map (filter isAlpha) xs
```

### Combinators

Functions that combine other functions:

```haskell
-- Identity combinator
identity :: a -> a
identity x = x

-- Constant combinator
const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x

-- Flip combinator
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
flip f x y = f y x

-- Examples
map (const 0) [1,2,3,4]         -- [0,0,0,0]
zipWith (flip div) [1,2,3] [10,20,30] -- [10,10,10]
```

## Lambda Functions

### Lambda Syntax

```haskell
-- Lambda function syntax
\parameter1 parameter2 -> expression

-- Examples
(\x -> x * 2)
(\x y -> x + y)
(\(x,y) -> x * y)
```

### When to Use Lambda Functions

1. **Short, one-off functions**
2. **Inline function arguments**
3. **Quick transformations**
4. **Pattern matching in anonymous functions**

```haskell
-- Lambda examples
squares = map (\x -> x * x) [1,2,3,4]
evenNumbers = filter (\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0) [1..10]
```

### Lambda with Pattern Matching

```haskell
-- Using LambdaCase extension
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

processEither :: [Either String Int] -> [String]
processEither = map (\case
    Left err -> "Error: " ++ err
    Right n -> "Success: " ++ show n)
```

## Advanced Function Concepts

### Recursive Functions as Higher-Order

```haskell
-- Higher-order recursive function
mapTree :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
mapTree f Empty = Empty
mapTree f (Node x left right) = Node (f x) (mapTree f left) (mapTree f right)

-- Fold for trees
foldTree :: (a -> b -> b -> b) -> b -> Tree a -> b
foldTree f z Empty = z
foldTree f z (Node x left right) = f x (foldTree f z left) (foldTree f z right)
```

### Function Factories

Functions that create other functions:

```haskell
-- Creating validators
makeValidator :: (a -> Bool) -> String -> (a -> Either String a)
makeValidator predicate errorMsg = \x ->
    if predicate x
        then Right x
        else Left errorMsg

-- Usage
positiveValidator = makeValidator (>0) "Must be positive"
nonEmptyValidator = makeValidator (not . null) "Must not be empty"
```

### Memoization

Caching function results for performance:

```haskell
-- Simple memoization for fibonacci
memoFib :: Int -> Integer
memoFib = (map fib [0..] !!)
  where
    fib 0 = 0
    fib 1 = 1
    fib n = memoFib (n-1) + memoFib (n-2)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Efficiency of Higher-Order Functions

1. **Fusion**: GHC can optimize chains of higher-order functions
2. **Inlining**: Small functions get inlined for better performance
3. **Strictness**: Use strict folds when building up large data structures

```haskell
-- Good: Fusion optimization possible
processNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers = map (*2) . filter (>0) . map (+1)

-- Less optimal: Intermediate lists created
processNumbers' :: [Int] -> [Int]
processNumbers' xs = 
    let step1 = map (+1) xs
        step2 = filter (>0) step1
        step3 = map (*2) step2
    in step3
```

### Space Considerations

```haskell
-- Space leak with foldl
badSum = foldl (+) 0  -- Builds up thunks

-- Good: Strict evaluation
goodSum = foldl' (+) 0  -- Evaluates immediately
```

## Best Practices

### Function Design

1. **Small, focused functions**: Each function should do one thing well
2. **Pure functions**: Avoid side effects when possible
3. **Meaningful names**: Function names should describe their purpose
4. **Type signatures**: Always provide type signatures for top-level functions

### Composition Guidelines

1. **Read left to right**: Use (.) for data transformation pipelines
2. **Use ($) judiciously**: Avoid parentheses where it improves readability
3. **Point-free when clear**: Use point-free style when it enhances clarity
4. **Partial application**: Leverage currying for reusable functions

### Common Patterns

```haskell
-- Pattern: Processing pipelines
analyzeText :: String -> (Int, Int, [String])
analyzeText text = 
    let ws = words text
        wordCount = length ws
        charCount = length . filter (not . isSpace) $ text
        longWords = filter ((>5) . length) ws
    in (wordCount, charCount, longWords)

-- Pattern: Validation chains
validateUser :: User -> Either String User
validateUser user = 
    validateEmail (email user) >>
    validateAge (age user) >>
    validateName (name user) >>
    return user
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Overusing Point-Free Style

```haskell
-- Too obscure
mysterious = (.) . (.) . (.)

-- Better: Clear and readable
compose3 f g h x = f (g (h x))
```

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Laziness

```haskell
-- May cause space leaks
processLargeList = foldl (+) 0 . map expensiveFunction

-- Better: Use strict fold
processLargeList' = foldl' (+) 0 . map expensiveFunction
```

### Mistake 3: Not Leveraging Partial Application

```haskell
-- Verbose
isPositive x = x > 0
doubleList xs = map (\x -> x * 2) xs

-- More idiomatic
isPositive = (>0)
doubleList = map (*2)
```

This comprehensive understanding of functions and higher-order patterns forms the foundation for advanced Haskell programming and leads naturally into more sophisticated abstractions like functors and monads.
