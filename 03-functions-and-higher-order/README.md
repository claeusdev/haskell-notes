## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Function Composition
```haskell
-- Data processing pipeline
processEmployee :: String -> Employee
processEmployee = normalizeEmployee . parseEmployee . validateInput
```

### Partial Application
```haskell
-- Create specialized functions
highEarners :: [Employee] -> [Employee]
highEarners = filter ((>70000) . salary)

seniorStaff :: [Employee] -> [Employee]
seniorStaff = filter ((>=5) . yearsService)
```

### Higher-Order Abstractions
```haskell
-- Generic ranking function
rankBy :: (a -> Double) -> [a] -> [(Int, a)]
rankBy metric = zip [1..] . sortBy (flip compare `on` metric)
```

## 🛠 Practice Exercises

### Beginner
1. Implement `myMap`, `myFilter`, and `myFold` from scratch
2. Create a pipeline for text processing (words, filtering, counting)
3. Build a simple calculator using function composition
4. Write functions using only point-free style

### Intermediate
1. Extend the data processor with new analysis functions
2. Implement a generic sorting library with custom comparisons
3. Create a validation framework using higher-order functions
4. Build a simple query language for data filtering

### Advanced
1. Implement lens-like functionality for record updates
2. Create a generic parser combinator library
3. Build a streaming data processor with constant memory usage
4. Implement automatic function memoization

## 🔗 Prerequisites

- Complete Section 2: Basic Syntax and Types
- Understanding of recursion and pattern matching
- Familiarity with list operations

## 🔗 Next Steps

After mastering this section:
1. **Section 4: Pattern Matching and Recursion** - Advanced recursion techniques
2. **Section 5: Algebraic Data Types** - Custom type creation
3. **Section 8: Monads and Functors** - Abstract patterns for effects

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Function Composition Benefits
- **Fusion**: GHC can optimize composed functions into efficient loops
- **Modularity**: Easy to reason about and test individual components
- **Reusability**: Small functions can be combined in many ways

### Common Optimizations
```haskell
-- Good: Enables fusion
efficientPipeline = map f . filter p . map g

-- Less optimal: Forces intermediate lists
inefficientPipeline xs = map f (filter p (map g xs))
```
